            <h2>What is Elo?</h2>
            <p>
                Elo is a dynamic player rating system originally developed for
                chess. On this site, I've adapted Elo for tennis. Tennis Elo
                provides a more accurate and responsive measure of player
                strength than traditional ranking systems based on tournament
                performance like the ATP and WTA because Elo updates after every
                match, focusing on outcomes of matches instead of circumstance.
            </p>

            <h2>The Elo Formula</h2>
            <p>
                <code>Elo_new = Elo_old + K × (Actual – Expected)</code>
            </p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul class="badge-list">
                <li><code>Actual</code> = 1 for a win, 0 for a loss</li>
                <li>
                    <code>Expected</code> = 1 / (1 + 10 ^ ((OpponentElo -
                    YourElo) / 400))
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>K</code> = 32 (compared to 16 in chess, for tennis
                    players compete less frequently, so each match carries more
                    weight)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                Elo updates after every match and gives more weight to bigger
                upsets. Beating a stronger player raises your Elo significantly;
                beating a weaker player does not.
            </div>

            <h2>How to Interpret Elo</h2>
            <p>
                Elo is best used as a predictive tool. The greater the
                difference between two players’ Elo scores, the greater the
                expected win probability for the higher-rated player. Here are
                some typical examples:
            </p>
            <table
                style="
                    width: 35%;
                    border-collapse: collapse;
                    margin: 20px 0;
                    font-size: 16px;
                "
            >
                <thead>
                    <tr
                        style="
                            background-color: #181818;
                            border-bottom: 1px solid #333;
                        "
                    >
                        <th
                            style="
                                padding: 10px 20px;
                                padding-right: 55px;
                                text-align: left;
                            "
                        >
                            Elo Difference
                        </th>
                        <th
                            style="

                                padding-right: 0;
                                text-align: left;
                            "
                        >
                            Higher Player Win Chance
                        </th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333">
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">25</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">53%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333">
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">50</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">58%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333">
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">100</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">65%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #333">
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">200</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">75%</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">400</td>
                        <td style="padding: 10px 20px">90%</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                So the difference in Elo, not just who is higher rated, matters,
                as a 100-point advantage suggests a clear edge, while a 25-point
                difference is almost a toss-up.
            </p>

            <h2>Elo vs Atp</h2>
            <p>
                While ATP rankings use a points-based system from tournament
                rounds, Elo is opponent-sensitive, reflecting <em>who</em> you
                beat, not just how far you advance. This makes Elo much better
                at predicting match outcomes.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                Elo difference is especially useful in games between closely
                matched players, where ATP ratings become almost obsolete.
            </div>

            <div class="image-grid">

                <img src="../atp.png" alt="ATP win % correlation graph" />
            </div>

            <p>Based on match data:</p>
            <ul class="badge-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>33,459</strong> matches were upsets using ATP
                    ranking
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>27,436</strong> matches were upsets using Elo rating
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Decay System</h2>
            <p>
                Elo ratings should reflect a player’s current strength—not just
                past performance. That’s why this system includes
                <strong>Elo decay</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul class="badge-list">
                <li>
                    If a player hasn’t played in <strong>365 days</strong>,
                    their Elo begins to decay
                </li>
                <li>
                    From Day 366 onward, their rating drops by
                    <strong>1 point per day</strong> of inactivity
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This helps prevent long-inactive players from skewing rankings
                or appearing stronger than they are. It’s especially useful for
                comeback situations: when a player returns after a long break,
                their Elo better reflects their current likelihood to win.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                In matches where Elo decay applied and the player returned to
                competition, predictive accuracy improved by
                <strong>21%</strong> compared to a static rating system.
            </div>
            <p>
                Decay also helps address <strong>Elo inflation</strong>. Elo
                assumes a closed system, but new players add points and retirees
                remove them. Over time, this can inflate ratings.
                <strong>Elo decay</strong> counters this by lowering inactive
                players’ ratings and keeping the system more accurate.
            </p>

            <h2>The Absence Penalty System</h2>
            <p>
                Decay also helps address <strong>Elo inflation</strong>. Elo
                assumes a closed system, but new players add points and retirees
                remove them. Over time, this can inflate ratings.
                <strong>Elo decay</strong> counters this by lowering inactive
                players’ ratings. And when players return, their
                <code>K</code>-value temporarily increases—an added adjustment
                that reflects uncertainty, like saying, “I don’t know how good
                you are, but I’ll keep a close eye.”
            </p>

            Elo with decay and return adjustment is calculated as:<br />
            <p>
                <code
                    >Elo_new = (Elo_old − Decay) + K_adj × (Actual −
                    Expected)</code
                >
            </p>

            <ul class="badge-list" style="margin-top: 8px">
                <li><code>Decay</code> = max(0, DaysInactive − 365)</li>
                <li><code>K_adj</code> = usually 64, but sometimes higher</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                This adjustment lasts for <strong>5 matches</strong> after a
                player's return, then reverts to the normal elo K value of 32.
            </div>

            <p>
                This helps recalibrate ratings more quickly for returning
                players who may be stronger or weaker than before. It also
                improves prediction accuracy and keeps Elo responsive to
                real-world conditions like injury, rest, or hiatus.
            </p>

            <h2>Era Comparisons</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most tempting uses of Elo is comparing players across
                generations. But while Elo offers a more stable benchmark than
                tour rankings, it isn’t well-suited for direct cross-era
                comparisons. A player from the 1980s with a 2400 rating isn't
                necessarily better than a modern player with the same rating.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take <strong>Björn Borg</strong> and
                <strong>Roger Federer</strong>, for example. Borg reached a
                higher peak Elo than Federer. But does that mean Borg would beat
                Federer head-to-head? Probably not. Elo doesn’t measure absolute
                ability—it reflects <em>dominance relative to one’s peers</em>.
                Borg faced weaker depth across the top of his time's field while
                Federer shared his peak years with both Djokovic and Nadal.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                Elo shows <strong>relative</strong> strength within a time
                period—not absolute skill across generations.
            </div>
            <h2>Player Titles</h2>
            <p>Players can earn badges based on their peak Elo:</p>
            <ul class="badge-list">
                <li><strong>Super Grandmaster</strong> – Elo 2350+</li>
                <li><strong>Grandmaster</strong> – Elo 2200+</li>
                <li><strong>International Master</strong> – Elo 2000+</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These badges are retained even if a player's elo drops below the
                minimum and if a player retires.
            </p>
